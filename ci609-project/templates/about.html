    <h2>Prediction Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      The {prediction algorithm} uses artificial intelligence to analyse team statistics and recent performances
      to estimate the most likely outcome of a football match. It has been trained using real match data
      from the top five European leagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      By identifying patterns in both long-term performance and short-term trends,
      the {prediction algorithm} is able to produce more accurate outcomes than simple win-loss comparisons.

    <h2>How It's Used</h2>
    <p>
      To use the {prediction algorithm}, simply choose a home team and an away team.
      The system will evaluate their recent form and historical results, then provide a predicted match outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Logged-in users can save their predictions, export them as a text file, and manage their prediction history.
      Guests can use the tool freely, but saving and exporting features are only available to registered users.

    <h2>AI Practices</h2>
    <p>
      The {prediction algorithm} was built with responsible AI practices in mind.
      It only uses real match statistics such as goals, shots, and team performance â€”
      no betting data or gambling odds are included.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tool is designed as an educational and analytical system.
      It is not intended for use in betting or gambling,
      and care has been taken to ensure predictions are based purely on in-game performance.

    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Only the essential information required to manage accounts and save predictions is collected.
      Passwords are securely encrypted, and no personal data is ever shared or used outside the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      The {prediction algorithm} does not use user data to improve its model.
      All data remains private, and users can delete their saved predictions or account information at any time.
